<img width="1362" height="1326" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb165a24-0b85-45fa-af84-8927378523d6" />
This project demonstrates a lightweight data pipeline for analyzing EV charging session reliability. Built in Python, it uses pandas, sqlite3, and matplotlib. The pipeline generates synthetic charging data, processes and cleans it, stores it in a SQLite database with a star schema, and produces a simple reliability report.

## Features
- **ETL pipeline** – reads raw session data from CSV, transforms variables, calculates metrics, and loads results into a relational database.  
- **Data modeling** – implements a small star schema with one fact table (`fact_charging`) and two dimension tables (`dim_station`, `dim_time`).  
- **Data quality & enrichment** – computes session duration, filters invalid records, and calculates per-station success rates.  
- **Reporting** – produces a bar chart (`station_reliability.png`) showing the reliability of each station.  

## Files
- `ev_charging_pipeline.py` – main script that runs the pipeline.  
- `charging_sessions.csv` – synthetic dataset generated by the script if not present.  
- `ev_charging.db` – SQLite database created by the script.  
- `station_reliability.png` – output plot showing per-station reliability.  
- `requirements.txt` – dependencies list.  
- `.gitignore` – ignores cache, venv, and generated files.  

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/EV_charging_pipeline.git
   cd EV_charging_pipeline
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run pipeline: 
python ev_charging_pipeline.py

Run dashboard:
streamlit run dashboard.py
